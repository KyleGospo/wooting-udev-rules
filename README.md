# wooting-udev-rules
Package that provides udev rules for all [Wooting](https://wooting.io/) analog keyboards for use with [Wootility](https://next.wooting.io/wootility).

## Installing

You can get releases for Fedora from my [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kylegospo/wooting-keyboards/).

See also my patched xpad driver that adds support for the Xbox controller this keyboard emulates [here](https://github.com/KyleGospo/wooting-xpad-dkms).
